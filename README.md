## CLOCs_LQS: An Implementation of CLOCs

CLOCs: Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates Fusion for 3D Object Detection. CLOCs is a novel Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates fusion network. This is my implementation based on Open-PCdet and MMDetection. The paper information can be found below.

Thanks to the original [implementation](https://github.com/pangsu0613/CLOCs), it helps me a lot. 

### Environment

```
numpy
torch
kornia==0.5.2
numba
pyyaml
easydict
```

Add the CLOCs directory to your PYTHONPATH, just add below line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'/dir/to/your/CLOCs/'
```
**All data you need can be downloaded from [here](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/U1EjFb)(or [Googledrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13h8452vcq0Wc-7p2BGMeJDpteHCDTdNs?usp=sharing)).**

### Install PCdet

The code is partly based on [Open-PCdet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet), you need to install it first to get 3D detection data. Or you can just use data from [here](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/U1EjFb)([Googledrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13h8452vcq0Wc-7p2BGMeJDpteHCDTdNs?usp=sharing)) without PCdet. Please follow the step [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet). Please remind that the PCdet should be installed in another folder not in this folder. 

### Install CLOCs
You can just run
```
python setup.py develop
```

### Get Fusion Results

#### Get detection results

1. You need to **prepare the 3D detection results and 2D detection results**. Please note that the results that do not go through NMS are better. 
2. For the **3D detection results**, you can just use the PCdet that you have installed to train your own model. Then you need to get the prediction results. If you want to get no NMS results, then you need to modified your config or model. Or you can download 3D detection results **[here](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/OFgs7G)(or [Googledrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tzajKim1Uh65zn4ABVHGC5TceK-IaWg_/view))**. If you can get the results have same format as I supplied, that will be OK also.
3. Here is my way to get 3D detection results. **If you have got them from Googledrive, you can just ignore the following.** In `OpenPCDet/tools/eval_utils/eval_utils.py` line 61：

```python
        annos = dataset.generate_prediction_dicts(
            batch_dict, pred_dicts, class_names,
            output_path=final_output_dir if save_to_file else None
        )
        det_annos += annos
```

​	Here, `annos` denotes one detection results for one input. You can add one line `torch.save(***)` or other method to save the detection results. Here you need to predict all dataset results that training and validation dataset. So that, you can train your CLOCs model and validate it.

4. You need to get 2D detection results, you can use [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) to get your results. Or you can download **[here](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/hFDjf2). (or [Googledrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_OvYFpsK12bn_TRDElbYmnTqmvyfpG-/view), this file is from original [CLOCs](https://github.com/pangsu0613/CLOCs) )**. The 2D result format is as below, almost same as kitti format.

```

#### Generate fusion input

First of all, you need to organize your 2D and 3D results as below:
```
.
└── clocs_data
    ├── 2D
    │   ├── 000000.txt
    │   ├── 000001.txt
    │   └── 000002.txt
    ├── 3D
    │   ├── 000000.pt
    │   ├── 000001.pt
    │   └── 000002.pt

```

Modify some parameters of the file `generate_data.py` following below instruction. Or you can just input this args when you run `python generate_data.py`.

```
'--rootpath' data dir where you save your all data

'--d2path' Name of the parent folder where the prediction results are stored, for example 'your_clocs_data_path/2D'

'--d3path' is same as above

'--infopath' is the path of the file 'kitti_infos_trainval.pkl' produced by pcdet

'--inputpath' is where the input data is stored

'--log-path' is the path where you want to store your model
```

if you modified above well, then just 

```
  python generate_data.py --args
```

then you can get the input data that stored in `'inputpath'`. Your data dir should be like below:
```
.
└── clocs_data(rootpath)
    ├── 2D(d2path)
    │   ├── 000000.txt
    │   ├── 000001.txt
    │   └── 000002.txt
    ├── 3D(d3path)
    │   ├── 000000.pt
    │   ├── 000001.pt
    │   └── 000002.pt
    └── input_data
        ├── 000000.pt
        ├── 000001.pt
        └── 000002.pt
```

#### Organize Your Data
You should organize your data dir as below:
```
.
└── clocs_data
    ├── 2D
    │   ├── 000000.txt
    │   ├── 000001.txt
    │   └── 000002.txt
    ├── 3D
    │   ├── 000000.pt
    │   ├── 000001.pt
    │   └── 000002.pt
    ├── index
    │   ├── train.txt
    │   ├── trainval.txt
    │   └── val.txt
    ├── info
    │   ├── kitti_infos_trainval.pkl
    │   └── kitti_infos_val.pkl
    └── input_data
        ├── 000000.pt
        ├── 000001.pt
        └── 000002.pt
```
Here, the index dir is copied from `./index` and the files in `info` are got from pcdet or you can download from [here](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/U1EjFb)([Googledrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13h8452vcq0Wc-7p2BGMeJDpteHCDTdNs?usp=sharing))


#### Train and Evaluation

1. Train the model. You need to modify the file `train.py` same as the `generate_data.py`. Then

```
python train.py
```

2. Validate your fusion results. Modify the file `eval.py` as above rule.  then

```
python eval.py
```

​	It will validate all your model, you can choose the best one.

3. Get baseline results.  Modify the file `baseline.py` as above rule.

### Some Tips

This implementation just store the input data, 3D detection data and 2D detection data in disks, so the training process is much faster than original CLOCs implementation. If you want to use CLOCs in other dataset or other detection method, you just need to modify the data pre-processing or just output the detection results as here defined. By following above, you can apply this fusion network in any method you want and it can be trained well in a short time.

### Acknowledgement

Our codes are inspired by [CLOCs](https://github.com/pangsu0613/CLOCs) a lot and are based on [PCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) and [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Thanks for their excellent work.
